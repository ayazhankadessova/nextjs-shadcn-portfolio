<Callout type='warning'>
Here's my honest take on the apps that actually help me stay organized (most days).

# My Digital Support System

Let me share the apps that have somehow survived my countless productivity experiments and earned their permanent spots on my devices:

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Garmin Connect: My Wellness Guardian

I never thought I'd be the person who checks their sleep stats, but here we are. This little device has become surprisingly essential:
- Helps me catch those "maybe I shouldn't work out today" moments
- Shows me when my body battery is actually empty (versus just wanting an excuse to skip exercise)
- Keeps me honest about my stress levels
- Reminds me that rest is as important as movement

## ‚úÖ Todoist: My Second Brain

This is where life gets sorted:
- A dumping ground for every "don't forget to..." thought
- Recurring reminders for those easily forgotten tasks (laundry, I'm looking at you)
- Gentle nudges to stay in touch with friends and family
- Personal goals that need regular attention

## üìö Notion: The Academic Organizer

I keep it simple here:
- Clean tables for university deadlines
- Application tracking without the fuss
- Just the essentials - because sometimes simpler is better
- I tried using complex Notion templates but I find it is too much for me :)

## üìù Google Docs: The Goal Keeper

Every year at the end of December, I set goals for next year in Google Docs, by months. 

So, my monthly goals live here in a refreshingly minimalist way:
- A focused 3-4 page document
- Key priorities across different areas of life
- Monthly check-ins that actually happen
- Just enough detail to stay on track without getting overwhelmed

## üìÖ Google Calendar: The Time Companion

Where everything comes together:
- Time blocks that help me stay realistic
- Meeting schedules that keep me punctual
- Visual reminders of how I spend my time
- Simple but effective daily structure

Find what works for you - these apps are just tools, not rules.

## Why This Works For Me

Each app has its clear purpose:
1. Garmin keeps me healthy and rested
2. Todoist ensures nothing slips through the cracks
3. Notion handles the academic side
4. Google Docs maintains my focus on goals
5. Calendar brings structure to my days

## Final Thoughts

The best productivity system is one that feels natural to use. Mine isn't perfect, but it's reliable enough to keep me moving forward while being flexible enough to adapt when life throws curveballs.

Remember: These tools should make life easier, not more complicated. If they're not helping, it's okay to try something else.
