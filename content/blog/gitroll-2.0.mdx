## The First Line

My journey into software engineering began not with a grand vision, but with curiosity. During my high school years in Kazakhstan, I discovered that computers could do more than just run programs – they could be instructed to create new ones. That realization sparked a passion that would shape my future.

## Learning to Learn

University introduced me to formal computer science, but the real education happened in hackathons and late-night coding sessions. Every project, whether successful or not, taught me something valuable. Looking back, I appreciate those moments of frustration that led to breakthroughs.

## The Corporate Classroom

At J.P. Morgan, I learned that software engineering isn't just about writing code – it's about solving real problems. Working on DEI initiatives and infrastructure automation showed me how technology can create meaningful impact. Each challenge pushed me to grow not just as a coder, but as a problem solver.

## The Side Projects That Shaped Me

Between internships and classes, I built projects that mattered to me: an Android app for HKBU volunteers, a real-time Python learning platform. These weren't just portfolio pieces – they were expressions of my belief that technology should serve a purpose beyond itself.

## The Present and Future

Today, I am building my skills through projects! 

## Key Learnings

1. **Technical excellence is just the beginning.** The best solutions come from understanding the human side of the problem.

2. **Embrace the unknown.** Every new technology I've learned has opened unexpected doors.

3. **Build with purpose.** The most satisfying projects are those that solve real problems for real people.

4. **Community matters.** The tech community has been instrumental in my growth, whether through hackathons, open source, or mentorship.

## Looking Forward

As I continue this journey, I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. Technology is evolving rapidly, but the fundamentals remain: curiosity, persistence, and a desire to make a positive impact.

The code I write today may be different from my first programs, but the motivation remains the same – to create something meaningful, to solve interesting problems, and to keep learning every step of the way.
