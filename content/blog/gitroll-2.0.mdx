## Skills-based Assessments

Rather than relying too heavily on resumes and degrees, implementing robust technical assessments that evaluate candidates' relevant skills and problem-solving abilities can help surface more qualified, diverse talent.

Some key benefits of skills-based assessments include:

- **Reducing Bias:** By focusing on tangible skills rather than subjective factors like pedigree, skills assessments can help mitigate the impact of unconscious biases in the hiring process.

- **Identifying Hidden Talent:** Technical assessments can uncover qualified candidates who may not have the "traditional" background but possess the necessary skills and problem-solving abilities.

- **Improving Quality of Hire:** Skills-based evaluations ensure hiring decisions are based on demonstrated competence, leading to more successful hires that perform well on the job.

- **Enhancing Diversity:** By casting a wider net and considering a more diverse pool of candidates, skills-based hiring can help tech companies build more inclusive and representative engineering teams.

To implement effective skills-based assessments, companies should:

1. Define the core technical and problem-solving competencies required for the role.
2. Develop or curate rigorous, job-relevant assessment exercises and coding challenges.
3. Train hiring managers on best practices for administering and evaluating the assessments.
4. Monitor the process for any unintended bias or disparate impact, and continuously iterate to improve fairness.

Putting skills at the center of the hiring process can be a powerful lever for surfacing diverse, high-quality engineering talent. By focusing on what candidates can do rather than what's on their resume, companies can build stronger, more innovative teams.
