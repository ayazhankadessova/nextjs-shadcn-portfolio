## Case Study: Designing and Developing the HKBU Iftar 2025 Landing Page

As a UI/UX designer and developer, I created the landing page for the **HKBU Iftar 2025** event, a community gathering at Hong Kong Baptist University to celebrate the breaking of the fast during Ramadan. This project stemmed from my role in organizing the annual Iftar, which drew **over 100 participants**. 

### Key Objectives
- **Centralize essential information** to reduce inquiries and enhance coordination
- Build with **Next.js** for efficient performance and responsiveness
- Create a **single source of truth** for event logistics

### Project Background and Requirements

Drawing from the previous year's experience, where participants frequently messaged with questions about logistics, I identified the need for a dedicated resource. 

**Common inquiries included:**
- Event location and timetable
- Food options
- Prayer facilities
- Appropriate attire
- Feedback submission

**Key priorities from organizer meeting:**
- ✅ Clear navigation to address common queries
- ✅ Inviting design to foster community and spiritual reflection
- ✅ Minimalistic structure for quick access

**Impact:** This user-centered approach significantly minimized redundant questions in 2025—particularly regarding location and scheduling—allowing organizers and participants to focus on the event itself.

### Research and Inspiration

To establish a foundation, I examined **visual design elements** and **design principles**:

**Design Elements:**
- Color, typography, shape, and space

**Design Principles:**
- Hierarchy, contrast, balance, and unity
- **Gestalt principles** (proximity and similarity) for intuitive information grouping

**Layout Research:**
- Reviewed similar event sites
- Favored **single-column format** for mobile-friendly readability

**Typography Choices:**
- **PDN Script** – Elegant headings to evoke tradition
- **Montserrat** – Modern, accessible body text
- This combination supported both accessibility and cultural resonance

<div
	style={{
		display: 'flex',
		gap: '0.75rem',
		justifyContent: 'center',
		alignItems: 'flex-start',
		flexWrap: 'wrap',
		rowGap: '0.75rem',
		maxWidth: '860px',
		margin: '1rem auto 0',
	}}
>
	{[
		// '/projects/runville/onboarding-stories/onb-1.png',
		'/projects/iftar/iftar-3.png',
	].map((src, index) => (
		<img
			key={src}
			src={src}
			alt={`Runville onboarding story ${index + 1}`}
			style={{ width: '160px', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '12px', flex: '0 1 120px' }}
			loading='lazy'
		/>
	))}
</div>

### Low-Fidelity Wireframing

I initiated the process with **low-fidelity wireframes** to outline structure rapidly.

**Approach:**
- Used placeholders for text, icons, and sections
- Avoided colors or images to concentrate on **flow and functionality**

**Key sections:**
- Hero banner for welcome message
- Timetable and location details
- FAQ accordion
- Feedback form

**Outcome:** Quick validation of content organization, confirming alignment with user needs before refinement.

### Mid-Fidelity Development

Advancing to mid-fidelity, I incorporated design assets into a **grid-based layout** for consistency.

**Refinements:**
- Enhanced **hierarchy and proximity** for navigation bars, buttons, and text blocks
- Added stock images as placeholders for event visuals
- Ensured design supported intuitive interactions

**Iteration:**
- Gathered feedback from organizers
- Expanded FAQ section based on feedback
- Optimized usability while keeping design grayscale

### High-Fidelity Design and Implementation

In the high-fidelity stage, I applied a **curated color palette** to evoke warmth and invitation:

**Color Palette:**
- **#F3F0BC** – Tranquility and calmness
- **#052E16** – Grounding stability
- **#CA8A04** – Optimistic warmth
- **#FB7185** – Joyful accent
- **#FFFFFF** – Clean clarity

These choices reinforced themes of **community and reflection**, with contrast ensuring readability.
