### About

This `NextJS` project is an attempt to clone [`GitRoll-blog`](https://gitroll.io/blog), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using `TailwindCSS`, `MDX`, `Contentlayer`, and `shadcn/ui` + `lucide-react` components.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
